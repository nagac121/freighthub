- [How to run API server](#how-to-run-api-server)

## Functionality

The main goal is for the user to check the shipments at a glance. This allows users to take faster decisions and plan ahead of time.

Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issues.

## Use cases

- The user shall be able to:
  - See shipments in pages of 20 elements per page
  - Search by shipment id
  - Sort by different fields (e.g. id, name) in ascending/descending order
  - View the shipment information on a separate shipment details page
  - Update the shipment name (should persist when the page is reloaded)

The interactions should not refresh the page.

# Run API server

The project includes a small service for data fetching. The file `db.json` includes all the necessary data to achieve the goal. follow the steps below to start the server:

```
yarn or npm install .
yarn server or npm run server
```

Check [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for more information.
